# put numbers in squares
## do it

### in this game, pick a grid 3x3 or above (just type 1 number when asked. oh i should make that a dropdown menu. oops oh well.) anyway. then pick a square to put "1" in. choose squares adjacent (diagonals included) sequentially placing numbers. the goal is to have as many prime numbers (in blue) in the same rows or columns as possible. e.g., a 4x4 grid contains #s 1-16, and there are 6 primes between 1 and 16. so, the goal would be to put, like, 4 in one column, and the other two in the same row, so you get a column with 4 and a row with 3. eventually i'll add scoring that does that for you. and a game over when you softlock.
